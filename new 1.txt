new file for git test
Change again!

New change from local. --It is pushed from local without any pull request. Because it is pushed by owner?

SSH key bind into acc, but I still need to type the user/pass. 
Generated new key and try again! 

Need to change the origin from HTTPs to SSH
to skip the user/pass steps. Let me try again!

It works. But ask yes/no one time. Has warning added some RSA to list of known hosts.
It should not ask again. Let me try!
